    stood for over two centuries, covering an expansive 141 acres. It belonged
    to Ehelepola Maha Adikaram and served as the residence of Ehelepola
    Kumarihami, the most esteemed noblewoman of the Kandyan Kingdom, as well as
    Prince Veera Madduma Bandara. In 1818, the British seized the Ehelepola
    Walawwa and repurposed it as a prison. More than 50 high-profile rebel
    leaders, including Ehelepola Maha Adikaram and Keppetipola Disawe, were
    among the first to be incarcerated within its walls. It was said that the
    British altered the Walawwaâ€™s original structure, adding prison cells to the
    property, marking a significant transformation in its historical narrative.`;
